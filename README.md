# Golden_Pulps

This is a great website about Whiz Comics from the golden age of comic collecting because it demonstrates how to make a page responsive to different device screen sizes.  The CSS in this project uses the @media rule to define display properties for a mobile screen with a screen width less than 480px and for tablet and desktop over 481px.  This makes the look and feel of the website much more manageable for small mobile screens by encapsulating the images into flexbox and setting the image width to 100% so that, each frame from the comic gets it's own line and can be read from top to bottom naturaly while on desktop, the formatting retains more of a comic book feel by defining the flex properties of the images to varying sizes based on it's class.  The nav and footer elements are displayed differently on each platform and there is a printable version of the site pages that prints it out like a comic book and omits the descriptions and links. 
The stories told by the store owner are very interesting as well.
